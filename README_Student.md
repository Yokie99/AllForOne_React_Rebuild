All for One React Rebuild - Recreate a website using all the mini challenge endpoints using React
Peer Reviewer: Joseph Poncini
Review: Project is looking good and similar to the figma. I tested all the endpoints and couldn't get any of them to break. Data validation on the endpoints are good. Desktop is good but tablet and mobile could use more break points.
